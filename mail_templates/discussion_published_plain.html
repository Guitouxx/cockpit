Hello!

That’s it!
You have completed your discussion. You can finally discover who was your penfriend :)
I just published your discussion on the website : http://{{final}} and I will feature your discussion on our Facebook
page (https://www.facebook.com/fiiiirst/) and on our Instagram account (https://www.instagram.com/fiiiirst/)

What's the next step now?

Fiiiirst continue to exist with great discussions and this new year will be a major one for us, because I have the objective to produce a photobook which contains the discussions of the first two editions.
It would be different from what we can see on the website, there will be a selection and the final pictures would be mixed and re-arrange to create a global discussion between all of you.

What do I need from all of you?

- I need the pictures you submitted in your discussion in high resolution (maximum size you have and minimum 300dpi)
- I need also your short biography and the url of your portfolio (I can use the same url and bio in your portfolio account if there is no changes)
- Here is an editor contract (http://fiiiirst.com/fiiiirst-contract.pdf) for the book which will answer some points like the number of editions, copies, copyrights,
etc.. Please read it carefully. You can send me by email the last page with your signature.

I suppose you can send me your pictures via wetransfer at guillaume@fiiiirst.com

Thanks you very much.
I hope to release the book in the fall of 2018.

ps: if you don’t want to be include in the book, please send me a confirmation.

I hope you appreciated this experience and I thank you for your active participation.
Keep up the good work !!

Thanks,
Guillaume Tomasi - guillaume@fiiiirst.com
