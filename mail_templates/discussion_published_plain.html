Hello!

That’s it!
You have completed your discussion. You can finally discover who was your penfriend :)
I just published your discussion on the website : http://{{final}} and I will feature your discussion on our Facebook
page (https://www.facebook.com/fiiiirst/) and on our Instagram account (https://www.instagram.com/fiiiirst/)

What's the next step now?

Fiiiirst continue to exist with great discussions and our next goal is to release a serie of photobooks
It would be different from what we can see on the website, there is a selection and the final pictures are mixed and
re-arranged to create a global discussion between all of you.

What do I need from all of you?

- I need the pictures you submitted in your discussion in high resolution (maximum size you have and minimum 300dpi)
- I need also your short biography and the url of your portfolio

I suppose you can send me your pictures via wetransfer at guillaume@fiiiirst.com

Thanks you very much.

ps: if you don’t want to be include in the book, please send me a confirmation.

I hope you appreciated this experience and I thank you for your active participation.
Keep up the good work !!

Thanks,
Guillaume Tomasi - guillaume@fiiiirst.com
